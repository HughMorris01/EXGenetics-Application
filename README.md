## 🎯 About the Project

**The Problem:** Excelsior Genetics is experiencing extended administrative delays in securing their New York State cannabis license. They need a robust digital footprint to legitimize their brand, showcase their 20-year cultivation expertise, and rally local community support to pressure state officials.

**The Solution:** An informational Node.js/Express web application utilizing server-side rendered EJS templates. It features a deep-dive into their cultivation science, a secure partnership contact portal, and a custom backend web scraper that fetches live petition signatures to drive political leverage.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 📊 **Dynamic Petition Scraper:** Custom Node.js middleware that scrapes Change.org in real-time, injecting live signature counts directly into the UI.
* 🤝 **Partnership Portal:** A secure, AJAX-driven contact form utilizing Google reCAPTCHA v3 to prevent spam, and Nodemailer (via Zoho SMTP) for automated lead-routing.
* ⚡ **Stateless Architecture:** Highly optimized, file-based content routing using EJS templates for lightning-fast page loads without the overhead of a database.
* 🔞 **Session-Based Age Gate:** A seamless 21+ verification wall that locks scrolling and stores consent in `sessionStorage` to prevent intrusive popups on subsequent page loads.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

To fully run this project locally (specifically the contact form), you will need to add the following environment variables to a `.env` file in the root directory. The contact form triggers automated emails from the "digital liason" to both the inquirer advising of receipt of inquiry, as well as notification to the two company principals.

```env
PORT=3000
DIGITAL_LIASON_EMAIL=liason_email@example.com
DIGITAL_LIASON_PASSWORD=liason_password
ADMIN1_EMAIL=admin1@example.com
ADMIN2_EMAIL=admin2@example.com
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_google_recaptcha_secret
```
