        <p>
          Excelsior Genetics was established in 2023, but our foundation was
          laid over two decades ago. Our founding principal brings
          <span>more than 20 years of elite cultivation experience</span> to the
          brand—a journey that has spanned across the United States and far
          beyond international borders. This global knowledge wasn’t learned in
          a boardroom; it was <span>forged in the soil</span> of diverse
          climates and cultures, mastering the nuances of landrace genetics and
          modern hybrids alike.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is to provide top-quality cannabis products by sourcing
          and <span>perfecting the best genetics</span> in the industry. We
          believe that every cultivar has a full genetic potential that can only
          be unlocked through
          <span>organic, sustainable, and intentional practices.</span> By
          blending old-world cultivation wisdom with modern environmental
          stewardship, we produce flower that is as clean as it is potent. For
          us, <span>excellence is a promise</span> to our partners and the
          community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Excelsior Genetics serves as the parent company to
          <strong
            ><a href="http://northernlegacyny.com">Northern Legacy</a></strong
          >, our upcoming retail arm based in Alexandria Bay, NY. As a
          <span>vertically integrated Microbusiness applicant</span>, we have
          designed our operation to be a "seed-to-sale" craft powerhouse. This
          unique license allows us to maintain total control over the entire
          lifecycle of the plant—allowing us to not only supply our own
          dispensary but to
          <span>set the benchmark for high-grade, love-grown cannabis</span> for
          other licensed retailers across the state.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite our deep roots, the transition to the legal market has
          presented challenges that we refuse to ignore. We are currently
          engaged in a
          <span
            >resolute legal battle with the New York Office of Cannabis
            Management (OCM)</span
          >
          to ensure our application receives the proper and fair review it
          deserves. We believe that the future of New York’s cannabis industry
          depends on the
          <span>inclusion of experienced legacy operators</span> who truly
          understand the plant. We are standing our ground to ensure that the
          Excelsior standard has a permanent place in the legal landscape.
        </p>

        <p>
          We remain steadfast in our pursuit,
          <span>connected by our love for the cultivars</span> and our
          commitment to the people who appreciate them. Whether you are a fellow
          dispensary owner looking for premium wholesale flower or a consumer
          waiting for our Northern Legacy doors to open, we thank you for your
          support. While laws may change, <span>true quality is timeless.</span>
