            <p>
                Excelsior Genetics was established in 2023, but our foundation was laid over two decades ago. Our
                founding principal brings <span>more than 20 years of elite cultivation experience</span> to the brand—a
                journey that has spanned across the United States and far beyond international borders. This global
                knowledge wasn’t learned in a boardroom; it was <span>forged in the soil</span> of diverse climates and
                cultures, mastering the nuances of landrace genetics and modern hybrids alike.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our mission is to provide top-quality cannabis products by sourcing and <span>perfecting the best
                    genetics</span> in the industry. We believe that every cultivar has a full genetic potential that
                can only be unlocked through <span>organic, sustainable, and intentional practices.</span> By blending
                old-world cultivation wisdom with modern environmental stewardship, we produce flower that is as clean
                as it is potent. For us, <span>excellence is a promise</span> to our partners and the community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Excelsior Genetics serves as the parent company to <strong><a
                        href="http://northernlegacyny.com">Northern
                        Legacy</a></strong>, our upcoming retail
                arm based in Clayton, NY. As a <span>vertically integrated Microbusiness applicant</span>, we have
                designed our operation to be a "seed-to-sale" craft powerhouse. This unique license allows us to
                maintain total control over the entire lifecycle of the plant—allowing us to not only supply our own
                dispensary but to <span>set the benchmark for high-grade, love-grown cannabis</span> for other licensed
                retailers across the state.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite our deep roots, the transition to the legal market has presented challenges that we refuse to
                ignore. We are currently engaged in a <span>resolute legal battle with the New York Office of Cannabis
                    Management (OCM)</span> to ensure our application receives the proper and fair review it deserves.
                We believe that the future of New York’s cannabis industry depends on the <span>inclusion of experienced
                    legacy operators</span> who truly understand the plant. We are standing our ground to ensure that
                the Excelsior standard has a permanent place in the legal landscape.
            </p>

            <p>
                We remain steadfast in our pursuit, <span>connected by our love for the cultivars</span> and our
                commitment to the people who appreciate them. Whether you are a fellow dispensary owner looking for
                premium wholesale flower or a consumer waiting for our Northern Legacy doors to open, we thank you for
                your support. While laws may change, <span>true quality is timeless.</span>
