        At the heart of Excelsior Genetics is a legacy of cultivation that spans
        <span class="highlight-orange">over twenty years and crosses international borders</span>. 
        Our principal has spent two decades refining his craft in diverse climates and top-tier facilities 
        across the country and abroad, evolving into a <strong>master of the plant’s full life cycle</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        This master-level oversight is precisely why we chose the <span class="highlight-orange">micro-business model</span>. 
        Unlike mass-market producers, we operate a closed-loop system where every plant is treated with artisanal precision. 
        For us, it isn’t about volume—it’s about <span class="highlight-white">terpene complexity and the transparency</span>
        our neighbors deserve.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        <strong>Northern Legacy</strong> is the retail manifestation of this expertise. We aren't just opening a shop; 
        we are establishing a destination for craft cannabis in a region we call home. Despite 
        <span class="highlight-red">nearly two years of administrative delays</span>, our resolve is rooted as deeply as our plants.
