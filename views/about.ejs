      <h1>Our Mission</h1>

      <p class="about-text">
        At the heart of Excelsior Genetics is a legacy of cultivation that spans
        <span class="highlight-orange"
          >over twenty years and crosses international borders</span
        >. Our principal has spent two decades refining his craft in diverse
        climates and top-tier facilities across the country and abroad, evolving
        into a <strong>master of the plant’s full life cycle</strong>. This
        deep, global perspective allows us to merge traditional techniques with
        modern horticultural science, ensuring every strain we stabilize is a
        masterpiece of profile and potency.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        This master-level oversight is precisely why we chose the
        <span class="highlight-orange">micro-business model</span>. Unlike
        mass-market producers, we operate a closed-loop system where every plant
        is treated with artisanal precision. By managing the entire journey from
        elite seed selection to final harvest, we maintain a standard of quality
        control that is impossible in industrial-scale operations. For us, it
        isn’t about volume—it’s about
        <span class="highlight-white"
          >terpene complexity and the transparency</span
        >
        our neighbors deserve.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        <strong>Northern Legacy</strong> is the retail manifestation of this
        expertise. We aren't just opening a shop; we are establishing a
        destination for craft cannabis in a region we call home. Despite
        <span class="highlight-red"
          >nearly two years of administrative delays</span
        >
        and state-level impropriety, our resolve is rooted as deeply as our
        plants. We remain standing, positioned at the gateway to the 1000
        Islands, ready to prove that world-class genetics are worth the wait.
