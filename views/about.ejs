          In an industry rapidly filling with venture capital and out-of-state
          corporate interests, <strong>Excelsior Genetics</strong> stands apart.
          We are not a boardroom creation.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Our leadership team, led by founder <strong>Jason Stowell</strong>,
          was raised on the rugged shores of the
          <strong>North Country and Wellesley Island</strong>. We grew up on
          this river. We know the people, the climate, and the resilience it
          takes to thrive here. This isn't just a business location to us; it is
          our home.

              Before planting a single seed for Excelsior, our principal
              embarked on a twenty-year odyssey. This wasn't a vacation; it was
              a <strong>Global Apprenticeship</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="copy-text">
              From the humid highlands of <strong>Haiti</strong> to the
              legendary facilities of the <strong>West Coast</strong>, he
              studied the plant in every conceivable environment. He learned
              that true quality isn't about expensive equipment—it's about
              understanding the plant's language. He returned to the 1000
              Islands not just with experience, but with a
              <strong>standard of excellence</strong> that didn't yet exist in
              New York.

          "Constraint is the mother of perfection."
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          When New York passed the MRTA, many saw the
          <strong>6-plant household limit</strong> as a restriction. We saw it
          as a gauntlet.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          For the past five years, we utilized this quota to ruthlessly refine
          our genetic library. We didn't have the luxury of keeping "good"
          plants. If a phenotype wasn't exceptional—if it didn't have the
          structure, the terpene profile, and the resilience we demanded—it was
          cut.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The strains you see today are the survivors. They are the
          <strong>Excelsior Elite</strong>, stabilized specifically for our
          Northern climate and ready for the legal market.

        <h2 class="chapter-title header-glow">The CCTM Covenant</h2>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Our readiness isn't just internal; it was state-verified. Excelsior
          Genetics was selected to participate in New York's
          <strong>Cannabis Compliance Training & Mentorship (CCTM)</strong>
          program.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          This was not a simple lottery. It was a
          <strong>competitive selection process</strong>. We faced a rigorous
          interview panel and deep vetting to prove we possessed the skill, the
          business acumen, and the integrity necessary to succeed. We were
          chosen because we represented the "first wave" of legitimate,
          high-quality operators.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Graduating from the CCTM came with a specific covenant from the State:
          <strong>Priority Access</strong> to licensure. We were told that if we
          proved our merit, the State would clear the path.

          <p class="copy-text">
            <strong>The Reality:</strong> Relying on that promise of priority
            access, we submitted our full application in
            <strong>November 2023</strong>. In early <strong>2024</strong>, we
            signed a lease for our retail location to bring
            <em>Northern Legacy</em> to life.

          We upheld our end of the agreement. We built the facility. We secured

          Yet, nearly two years later, we remain in an
          <strong>administrative standstill</strong>. The "priority" queue has
          stalled, and we are burning capital to keep a dream alive while
          bureaucratic delays prevent us from opening our doors. We are fighting
          not just for a license, but for the integrity of the promise made to
          local entrepreneurs.
